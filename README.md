# cpp-mono-vo

This is a monocular visual odometry pipeline I am writing as a personal project.
I will be working with OpenCV functions; see [here](https://github.com/mattboler/matlab-VO) for a repository where I implement common visual navigation functions in Matlab.

## Prerequisites

This is written and tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

### Libraries

* OpenCV 4.1.0

## Installation

Clone the repository and

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

## Configuration
